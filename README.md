# Green Harmony

Green Harmony (*de:* Grüne Harmonie, *fr:* Harmonie verte, *es:* Harmonía verde, *cs:* Zelená harmonie, *pt:* Harmonia verde, *jp:* 緑の調和, *ko:* 녹색 조화, *zh:* 绿色和谐) is a Glyphs.app filter that G2-harmonizes selected “smooth” nodes.
 
## Usage

To harmonize the transition between two curve segments, select the green on-curve node between the two segments, and run *Filter > Green Harmony* (Ctrl-X). The selected on-curve node will be moved to the G2 position (‘harmonized’) between the two adjacent handles:

You can run the filter on multiple on-curve points. If none are selected, all green on-curve points will be harmonized.
 
## Custom Parameter
 
You can have the filter run on all smooth connections between curves at export time with a custom parameter. This can be useful for automatically fixing interpolations. To do so, go to *File > Font Info > Exports,* select an instance, add a *Custom Parameter* with the plus button, choose *Filter* from the menu that pops up, and write `GreenHarmony` in the filter value:

## Warning

Use of this filter may alter your shape(s) quite a lot, so make sure you make a backup (at least in the background layer) before you apply the filter to many glyphs. If you want to harmonize but still preserve the shape as much as possible, consider Tim Ahrens’ [Remix Tools](https://remix-tools.com).

## Installation

Green Harmony is [available in the Glyphs&nbsp;3 Plugin Manager](glyphsapp3://showplugin/Green%20Harmony). Click on the *Install* button next to it and restart Glyphs.
